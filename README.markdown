# deflate

Experimenting with a pure ruby decompressor for the DEFLATE algorithm.

## Why?

The ruby stdlib comes with [bindings to
zlib](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/zlib/rdoc/Zlib.html), which work
perfectly well for compressing and decompressing data using the DEFLATE
algorithm.

I was interested in learning more about the data formats though, so had a crack
at implementing a decompressor in pure ruby.

I'm not using this in the real world anywhere, and you probably shouldn't either.

## Usage

The API is unstable - refer to `spec/integration_spec.rb` for current examples.

## Tests

Run the tests like this:

    bundle
    bundle exec rspec
